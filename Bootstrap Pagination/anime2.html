<p>In 2006, one of the Japanese animation leaders Mamoru Hosoda released his masterpiece titled The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (時をかける少女). 
The fantasy anime film was based on the novel written by the best-selling sci-fi Japanese author Yasutaka Tsutsui in 1967, but it tells the different story from the novel’s one.</p>

<p>The setting of the anime is 20 years after the world in the novel. There are three main characters who are high schoolers in The Girl Who Leapt Through Time: Makoto, Kosuke and Chiaki. 
They live in the ordinary high school life, where there are general adolescent interests such as love, study and career choice in this anime. 
However, Makoto notices she becomes able to transport herself to the past.</p>

<p>Time travel is a popular plot of anime these days, but it was new and unique when the anime was released, which is partly because it is top rated by anime fans.</p>
